# T-Tests

Introduces hypothesis testing that leads to discussing the normal curve and z-test. 

## Learning Goals

- Understand how type 1 & type 2 errors can be made in hypothesis tests
- Perform a Student's t-test and interpret the results

## Lecture Materials

[Jupyter Notebook: Hypothesis Testing](hypothesis_testing.ipynb)

Note: This has the same name as the notebook for the z-tests lecture, but contains different content and is in a different location.

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 Mins)

Discuss what will be discussed for this lecture.

### Issues with Errors (20 Mins)

Discuss how the different errors a hypothesis test can make. Specifically Type I & II errors. Relate these to alpha & beta.

### t-Tests (20 Mins)

Discuss how t-tests relate to z-tests and show how to perform a t-test (one sample).

### Exercises (15 Mins)

A few example exercises to work as a group (do 2-3 of these).
