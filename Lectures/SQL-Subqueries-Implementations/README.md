# SQL Subqueries and Implementations

Two goals: (1) subqueries introduced as one final piece of syntax, and (2) SQL dialectal and platform differences introduced, especially including a web interface (such as on data.world).

Materials:
- [Jupyter Notebook: SQL Subqueries](sql_subqueries.ipynb)

## Before Lecture Prep

Have students set up a free account at [data.world](https://data.world).

## Learning Goals

- Use SQL subqueries to nest queries
- Identify common SQL dialects and tools
- Query data from web databases

## Lesson Plan 

### Introduction (5 Mins)

More complex queries are possible -- we'll look at the construction of subqueries here, but also want students to have a sense of the variety of SQL interfaces.

### Subqueries (20 Mins)

Note how subqueries can appear within different clauses of the containing query.

### CTEs (10 Mins)

Listed as a level-up, but asking students to take five minutes to try to do the exercise may be worth it.

### Varieties / Dialects (10 Mins)

### Exploring data.world (10 Mins)

Students need not work on the exercises here. They can simply explore the API.

### Conclusion (5 Mins)

The server-client structure of many forms of SQL we'll be picking up when we talk about APIs next!
