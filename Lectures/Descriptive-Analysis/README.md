# Descriptive Analysis

The main goal here is to introduce some fundamental notions from statistics that students can use to describe their data. They will also use plotting tools to illustrate features of their datasets.

Materials:
- [Jupyter Notebook: Descriptive Statistics](descriptive_stats.ipynb)

## Learning Goals

- Use business context to guide exploratory analyses
- Pose clear business-relevant questions and answer them with data
- Identify limitations of data for solving business problems

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 Mins)

Frame this as the first step of working with any new dataset: running descriptives on all your features. This is a cornerstone of the EDA process, which will help them figure out what to analyze and how.

### Measures of Center and Spread (15 Mins)

Students will likely be familiar with the basics here already - as an activity, make them actually answer the discussion prompts, possibly discussing answers in pairs.

### Histograms and Box-and-Whisker (10 Mins)

Walk slowly through the interpretations of these graphs. The binning is a bit complicated, so walk through that slowly and use the different bin numbers to demonstrate potential pitfalls and that data viz is as much an art as a science.

### Fast Food Business Questions (15 Mins)

Illustrations of various possible business questions.

### Credit Transaction Business Questions (10 Mins)

Same. Good to use breakout rooms / small groups for the purpose.

### Conclusion (5 Mins)

Go over the code for these examples if there's anything unclear!

## Tips

Everything after the rock song activity is extra content if you have time. The artist song counts show the value of looking at skewness. The Iris analysis shows a couple fancy Seaborn plots students might find cool.
