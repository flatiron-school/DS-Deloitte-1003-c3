# Semester 1 Capstone Project Description

You've made it all the way through the Intensive portion of this course - take a minute to celebrate your awesomeness!

![awesome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project-v2-4/master/awesome.gif)

Now you will put your new skills to use with a large end-of-Semester project!

In this project description, we will cover:

* [***Project Overview:***](#project-overview) the project goal, audience, and dataset
* [***Deliverables:***](#deliverables) the specific items you are required to produce for this project
* [***Grading:***](#grading) how your project will be scored
* [***Getting Started:***](#getting-started) guidance for how to begin your first project

## Project Overview

For this project, you will use exploratory data analysis and statistical methods to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

### Business Problem

Computing Vision (a made-up company for the purposes of this project) sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t have much background in creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office using different samples of available data. You then will translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Computing Vision's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

Because it was collected from various locations, the different files have different formats. Some are compressed CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values) files that can be opened using spreadsheet software or `pd.read_csv`, while the data from IMDB is located in a SQLite database.

![movie data erd](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-ai-academy-semester1-capstone/raw/main/movie_data_erd.jpeg)

Note that the above diagram shows ONLY the IMDB data. You will need to look carefully at the features/columns to figure out how the IMDB data relates to the other provided data files.

It is up to you to decide what data from this to use and how to use it. If you are feeling overwhelmed or behind, we recommend you use only the following data files:

* `im.db.zip`
  * Zipped SQLite database (you will need to unzip then query using SQLite)
  * `movie_basics` and `movie_ratings` tables are most relevant
* `bom.movie_gross.csv.gz`
  * Compressed CSV file (you can open without expanding the file using `pd.read_csv`)

### Key Points

* **Your analysis should yield three concrete business recommendations.** The ultimate purpose of exploratory analysis is not just to learn about the data, but to help an organization perform better. Explicitly relate your findings to business needs by recommending actions that you think the business (Computing Vision) should take. 

* **Communicating about your work well is extremely important.** Your ability to provide value to an organization is directly reliant on your ability to communicate with them about what you have done and why it is valuable. Create a storyline your audience (the head of Computing Vision's new movie studio) can follow by walking them through the steps of your process, highlighting the most important points, and skipping over the rest.

* **Use plenty of relevant visualizations.** Visualizations are invaluable for exploring your data and making your findings accessible to a non-technical audience. Spotlight visuals in your presentation, but only ones that relate directly to your recommendations. Simple visuals are usually best (e.g. bar charts and line graphs), and don't forget to format them well (e.g. labels, titles).

* **Choose appropriate statistical inference techniques.** Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals can provide useful inferences about larger populations based on sample data. Using them helps to see larger insights that may not immediately be available from initial exploratory analysis.

You should have at least *two recommendations* based on your Data Communication work and at least *one recommendation* following your Statistical Communication work.

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **non-technical presentation** using the Deloitte Powerpoint template to follow good storyboarding and logical structure. More information is available to Deloitte employees [here](https://secure-web.cisco.com/1v6kvlFBED_pKFB1-EiO3J69aSvTLihv98oO6OAryDHDGAa1XLDluQA_RoTguOLSFFUzz-WCJmm5O-04Mt-Dk0IZCqApnb_XDpLUnEmc6vB49BmxGpkvFSOp3KKj-rd8FyZzJ2z73qZr5VYgjox55nPMt1JGaINm5EV6eeTDEzesXOaOEHxZJV4e93UKyG-qYEnMraJwA0ndhvicVcCh_6VnyB0j3k1r_Vcj_Aw0rTJhlUOYT_YB85Tl7IkpvoRnPDPV7BN9E6FM93eqt-7UtvhmPt6fr8O6SLuzaFcHsJpyHEDZBBbsk9IFoU1FauIhP544urgG2sMKGZ6VIdHyx-h7_K-M18z-x7MxPdrTrZbNUZiNRiwG4qymNAkriYkiHj7IudvYgMXrv9c1aonqC46lp7VAOPHmg0Aq7BPs5dR7LlmH4OK_V7OweyrEWNwqrOPFL9QrLNs-KWY_oFuCtEaBTPjNBPIvsxj4cWrozwTWcb02LYTixanfUgIVMxGUv4PAAL461Hnwh-GWWchyFng/https%3A%2F%2Fbecurious.edcast.eu%2Fpathways%2Fai-academy-storyboarding-resources).
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **GitHub repository**

### Non-Technical Presentation

The non-technical presentation is a slide deck presenting your analysis to business stakeholders.

* ***Non-technical*** does not mean that you should avoid mentioning the technologies or techniques that you used, it means that you should explain any mentions of these technologies and avoid assuming that your audience is already familiar with them.
* ***Business stakeholders*** means that the audience for your presentation is Computing Vision, not the class, teacher, or coach. Do not assume that they are already familiar with the specific business problem, but also do not explain to them what Computing Vision is.

The presentation describes the project ***goals, data, methods, and results***. It must include at least ***three visualizations*** which correspond to ***three business recommendations***.

We recommend that you follow this structure, although the slide titles should be specific to your project:

1. Beginning
    * Overview
    * Business Understanding
2. Middle
    * Data Understanding
    * Data Analysis
    * Statistical Inference
3. End
    * Recommendations
    * Next Steps
    * Thank You
       * This slide should include a prompt for questions as well as your contact information

You will give a live presentation of your slides and submit them in PDF format on Canvas. The slides should also be present in the GitHub repository you submit with a file name of `presentation.pdf`.

The graded elements of the presentation are:

* Presentation Content
* Slide Style
* Presentation Delivery and Answers to Questions

See the [Grading](#grading) section for further explanation of these elements.

For further reading on creating professional presentations, check out:

* [Presentation Content](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-presentation-content)
* [Slide Style](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-slide-design)

### Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook is a notebook that uses Python and Markdown to present your analysis to a data science audience.

* ***Python and Markdown*** means that you need to construct an integrated `.ipynb` file with Markdown (headings, paragraphs, links, lists, etc.) and Python code to create a well-organized, skim-able document.
  * The notebook kernel should be restarted and all cells run before submission, to ensure that all code is runnable in order.
  * Markdown should be used to frame the project with a clear introduction and conclusion, as well as introducing each of the required elements.
* ***Data science audience*** means that you can assume basic data science proficiency in the person reading your notebook. This differs from the non-technical presentation.

Along with the presentation, the notebook also describes the project ***goals, data, methods, and results***. It must include at least ***three visualizations*** which correspond to ***three business recommendations***.

You will submit the notebook in PDF format on Canvas as well as in `.ipynb` format in your GitHub repository.

The graded elements for the Jupyter Notebook are:

* Business Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Data Preparation
* Data Analysis
* Visualization
* Statistical Communication
* Code Quality

See the [Grading](#grading) section for further explanation of these elements.

### GitHub Repository

The GitHub repository is the cloud-hosted directory containing all of your project files as well as their version history.

A professional GitHub repository has:

1. `README.md`
    * A file called `README.md` at the root of the repository directory, written in Markdown; this is what is rendered when someone visits the link to your repository in the browser
    * This file contains these sections:
       * Overview
       * Business Understanding
          * Include stakeholder and key business questions
       * Data Understanding and Analysis
          * Source of data
          * Description of data
          * Three visualizations (the same visualizations presented in the slides and notebook)
       * Statistical Communication
          * Results of statistical inference
          * Interpretation of these results in the context of the problem
       * Conclusion
          * Summary of conclusions including three relevant findings
2. Commit history
   * Progression of updates throughout the project time period, not just immediately before the deadline
   * Clear commit messages
   * Commits from all team members
3. Organization
   * Clear folder structure
   * Clear names of files and folders
   * Easily-located notebook and presentation linked in the README
4. Notebook(s)
   * Clearly-indicated final notebook that runs without errors
   * Exploratory/working notebooks (can contain errors, redundant code, etc.) from all team members
5. `.gitignore`
   * A file called `.gitignore` at the root of the repository directory instructs Git to ignore large, unnecessary, or private files
     * Because it starts with a `.`, you will need to type `ls -a` in the terminal in order to see that it is there
   * GitHub maintains a [Python .gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore) that may be a useful starting point for your version of this file
   * To tell Git to ignore more files, just add a new line to `.gitignore` for each new file name
     * If you are running into an error message because you forgot to add something to `.gitignore` and it is too large to be pushed to GitHub [this blog post](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/tutorial-removing-large-files-from-git-78dbf4cf83a?sk=c3763d466c7f2528008c3777192dfb95) should help you address this

You will submit a link to the GitHub repository on Canvas.

See the [Grading](#grading) section for further explanation of how the GitHub repository will be graded.

## Grading

***To pass this project, you must pass each project rubric objective.*** The project rubric objectives for Phase 1 are:

1. Attention to Detail
2. Data Communication
3. Authoring Jupyter Notebooks
4. Data Manipulation and Analysis with `pandas`
5. Statistical Communication

### Attention to Detail

Attention to detail means that you accomplish tasks thoroughly and accurately. You need to understand what is being asked of you, and double-check that your work fulfills all of the requirements.


The *Deloitte AI Academy - Semester 1 Capstone Checklist* is in Canvas. The elements highlighted in yellow are the elements you need to complete in order to pass this objective. We recommend that you make your own copy of this document, so that you can check off each element as you complete it. The checklist also contains more specific, detailed guidance about the deliverables described above.

Below are the definitions of each rubric level for this objective. This information is also summarized in the rubric, which is attached to the project submission assignment.

#### Exceeds Objective
70% or more of the project checklist items are complete

#### Meets Objective (Passing Bar)
60% of the project checklist items are complete

#### Approaching Objective
50% of the project checklist items are complete

#### Does Not Meet Objective
40% or fewer of the project checklist items are complete

### Data Communication

Communication is another key "soft skill". For this project, you will be required to address both Data Communication and Statistical Communication. We define Data Communication as:

> Communicating basic data analysis results to diverse audiences via writing and live presentation

To further define some of these terms:

* By "basic data analysis" we mean that you are filtering, sorting, grouping, and/or aggregating the data in order to answer business questions. Here, descriptive statistics about the samples of data such as measures of central tendency are encouraged.
* By "results" we mean your ***three visualizations*** that provide background to your recommendations.
* By "diverse audiences" we mean that your presentation and notebook are appropriately addressing a business and data science audience, respectively.

Below are the definitions of each rubric level for this objective. This information is also summarized in the rubric, which is attached to the project submission assignment.

#### Exceeds Objective
Creates and describes appropriate visualizations for given business questions, where each visualization fulfills all elements of the checklist

> This "checklist" refers to the Data Visualization checklist within the larger Semester 1 Capstone Checklist

#### Meets Objective (Passing Bar)
Creates and describes appropriate visualizations for given business questions

> This objective can be met even if all checklist elements are not fulfilled. For example, if there is some illegible text in one of your visualizations, you can still meet this objective

#### Approaching Objective
Creates visualizations that are not related to the business questions, or uses an inappropriate type of visualization

> Even if you create very compelling visualizations, you cannot pass this objective if the visualizations are not related to the business questions

> An example of an inappropriate type of visualization would be using a line graph to show the correlation between two independent variables, when a scatter plot would be more appropriate

#### Does Not Meet Objective
Does not submit the required number of visualizations

### Authoring Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks allow for reproducible, skim-able code documents for a data science audience. The key feature that distinguishes *authoring Jupyter Notebooks* from simply *writing Python code* is the fact that Markdown cells are integrated into the notebook along with the Python cells in a notebook. You have seen examples of this throughout the curriculum, but now it's time for you to practice this yourself!

Below are the definitions of each rubric level for this objective. This information is also summarized in the rubric, which is attached to the project submission assignment.

#### Exceeds Objective
Uses Markdown and code comments to create a well-organized, skim-able document that follows all best practices

> Refer to the [repository readability reading](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-repo-readability-v2-2) from Flatiron School's Consumer program for more tips on best practices

#### Meets Objective (Passing Bar)
Uses some Markdown to create an organized notebook, with an introduction at the top and a conclusion at the bottom

#### Approaching Objective
Uses Markdown cells to organize, but either uses only headers and does not provide any explanations or justifications, or uses only plaintext without any headers to segment out sections of the notebook

> Headers in Markdown are delineated with one or more `#`s at the start of the line. You should have a mixture of headers and plaintext (text where the line does not start with `#`)

#### Does Not Meet Objective
Does not submit a notebook, or does not use Markdown cells at all to organize the notebook

### Data Manipulation and Analysis with `pandas`

`pandas` is a very popular data manipulation library, with over 2 million downloads on Anaconda (`conda install pandas`) and over 19 million downloads on PyPI (`pip install pandas`).

Unlike in base Python, where the Zen of Python says "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it", there is often more than one valid way to do something in `pandas`. However there are still more efficient and less efficient ways to use it. Specifically, the best `pandas` code is *performant* and *idiomatic*.

Performant `pandas` code utilizes methods and broadcasting rather than user-defined functions or `for` loops. For example, if you need to strip whitespace from a column containing string data, the best approach would be to use the [`pandas.Series.str.strip` method](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.strip.html) rather than writing your own function or writing a loop. Or if you want to multiply everything in a column by 100, the best approach would be to use broadcasting (e.g. `df["column_name"] * 100`) instead of a function or loop. You can still write your own functions if needed, but only after checking that there isn't a built-in way to do it.

Idiomatic `pandas` code has variable names that are meaningful words or abbreviations in English, that are related to the purpose of the variables. You can still use `df` as the name of your DataFrame if there is only one main DataFrame you are working with, but as soon as you are merging multiple DataFrames or taking a subset of a DataFrame, you should use meaningful names. For example, `df2` would not be an idiomatic name, but `movies_and_reviews` could be.

We also recommend that you rename all DataFrame columns so that their meanings are more understandable, although it is fine to have acronyms. For example, `"col1"` would not be an idiomatic name, but `"USD"` could be.

Below are the definitions of each rubric level for this objective. This information is also summarized in the rubric, which is attached to the project submission assignment.

#### Exceeds Objective
Uses `pandas` to prepare data and answer business questions in an idiomatic, performant way

#### Meets Objective (Passing Bar)
Successfully uses `pandas` to prepare data in order to answer business questions

> This includes projects that _occasionally_ use base Python when `pandas` methods would be more appropriate (such as using `enumerate()` on a DataFrame), or occasionally performs operations that do not appear to have any relevance to the business questions

#### Approaching Objective
Uses `pandas` to prepare data, but makes significant errors

> Examples of significant errors include: the result presented does not actually answer the stated question, the code produces errors, the code _consistently_ uses base Python when `pandas` methods would be more appropriate, or the submitted notebook contains significant quantities of code that is unrelated to the presented analysis (such as copy/pasted code from the curriculum or StackOverflow)

#### Does Not Meet Objective
Unable to prepare data using `pandas`

> This includes projects that successfully answer the business questions, but do not use `pandas` (e.g. use only base Python, or use some other tool like R, Tableau, or Excel)

### Statistical Communication

Recall that communication is one of the key data science "soft skills". In addition to Data Communication, we are also focused on Statistical Communication. We define Statistical Communication as:

> Communicating **results of statistical analyses** to diverse audiences via writing and live presentation

High-quality Statistical Communication includes rationale, results, limitations, and recommendations:

* **Rationale:** Explaining why you are using statistical analyses rather than basic data analysis
  * For example, why are you using hypothesis testing rather than just a graph?
  * What about the problem or data is suitable for this form of analysis?
  * For a data science audience, this includes your reasoning for the changes you applied and choices you made while building confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests.
* **Results:** Describing the findings of hypothesis tests and/or confidence intervals
  * You need run at least one hypothesis test or create at least one confidence interval.
  * For a business audience, make sure you connect any results from these statistical procedures to real-world implications. You do not need to get into the details of how hypothesis testing or confidence intervals work, but rather make sure to interpret the results of the analyses and its implications on the business problem.
  * Your statistical analyses should pair with *at least one* of the visualizations you created under Data Communication.
* **Limitations:** Identifying the limitations and/or uncertainty present in your analysis
  * This could include data collection concerns, assumptions of missing data, etc.
  * In general, this should be more in-depth for a data science audience and more surface-level for a business audience.
* **Recommendations:** Interpreting the statistical results and limitations in the context of the business problem
  * What should stakeholders _do_ with this information?

Make sure to pair at least one visualization with a statistical analyses here. This could, for example, correspond to showing boxplots of two groups in the sample as a lead in to a two sample t-test.

#### Exceeds Objective

Communicates the rationale, results, limitations, and specific recommendations of statistical analyses

> See above for extended explanations of these terms.

#### Meets Objective (Passing Bar)

Successfully communicates the results of statistical analyses without any major errors

> The minimum requirement is to communicate the _results_, meaning at least one hypothesis test or confidence interval is produced and interpreted. See the Approaching Objective section for an explanation of what a "major error" means.

#### Approaching Objective

Communicates the results of statistical analyses with at least one major error

> A major error means that some aspect of your explanation is fundamentally incorrect. For example, if a hypothesis test produced a large p-value (say, above 50%) but the hypothesis test was still rejected at the 10% significance level, that would be a major error. Another example would be if zero was found in a confidence interval looking at the range of possible values for a difference in the mean of two groups, but statistical signifance was still reported.

> The easiest way to avoid making a major error is to have someone double-check your work. Reach out to peers on Slack and ask them to confirm whether your interpretation makes sense!

#### Does Not Meet Objective

Does not communicate the results of statistical analyses

> It is not sufficient to just display the results from Python. You must explain what those numbers mean in the context of the problem.


## Getting Started

Please start by reviewing the contents of this project description. If you have any questions, please ask your instructor ASAP.

Then, you will need to create a new GitHub repository by going to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new). Then, download and copy the data files from [this folder in the capstone repo](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-ai-academy-semester1-capstone/tree/main/zippedData) into your new repository.

## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The capstone projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!
